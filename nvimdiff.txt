				HOW TO RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS WITH NVIMDIFF
===============================================================================
SETTING GIT MERGE TOOL

to set vimdiff or nvimdiff as your default merging tool, just run the 
following:
	
	git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
					or
	git config --global merge.tool nvimdiff

if you run this, instead

	git config --global merge.tool

you will be prompted with a list of available tools both already on the system
and those who can be installed but are not present.


===============================================================================
MERGING

To start the merging operation, run:
	
	git mergetool

							LAYOUT
			------------------------------------------
			|             |           |              |
			|   LOCAL     |   BASE    |   REMOTE     |
			|             |           |              |
			------------------------------------------
			|                                        |
			|                MERGED                  |
			|                                        |
			------------------------------------------

the MERGED pane is the FINAL version and while LOCAL and REMOTE are self 
explainatory, the BASE pane is only the "intersection" of LOCAL and 
REMOTE, in other words it is the common ancestor of LOCAL and REMOTE files.

To select the DIFF to get and put on the merged file, you can easly do it by:
	]c (next)
	[c (previous)

Now thje tricky part: once a diff is highlighted in the MERGED file, you can
use :diffget <source> to get the desired code from the desired file.

	:diffget LO  (from local)
	:diffget RE  (from remote)
	:diffget BA  (from base)

you can also edit code yourself by just getting a version from any of the above
versions first (you must diffget before editing) and then go to the insert mode
and edit as you wish.

since diffget command is defined as below:
```
	 :[range]diffg[et] [bufspec]
					Modify the current buffer to undo difference with another
					buffer.  [...]
					See below for [range].
When no [range] is given, the diff at the cursor position or just above it is
affected.  When [range] is used, Vim tries to only put or get the specified
lines.
```
you can diffget all chunks from only one of REMOTE, LOCAL or BASE, 
just use:

	:%diffget <source>

same goes for diffgetting from a selected range of code in visual mode:

	:'<,'>diffget <source>



Once done: save the merge result AND quit all windows `:wqa`

===============================================================================
ABORTING MERGE GRACEFULLY

If you want to abort merging the current file and not mark it as resolved, 
quit with :cquit instead of `:qa!`
